# What is Maktlo

Maktlo is a tool that takes:

1. The path of a small code file
2. A command to compile the code
3. Some natural language context

And feeds compiler errors to GPT3, and ask for a diff on how to change the file, until it compiles.

# Installation

Run `init.bash`

# Usage

Run maktlo.py

It would iterate on test.py until it runs perfectly. Feel free to replace the example test.py with anything of your choice.
